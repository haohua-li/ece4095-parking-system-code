## Set Up 

- Install Visual Studio 2017 <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/>
- Set up the configurations for OMPL, SDL2 by using [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)
  - SDL2 is deprecated because I was thinking for online simulation previously, but it turns out offline simulation is enough... 
  - OMPL http://ompl.kavrakilab.org/installation.html
  - SDL2 and Visual Studio [Setup SDL2 with VS2019 and vcpkg](https://randoruf.github.io/2021/03/23/install-sdl2-windows.html)
- Open Project in Visual Studio 2017
