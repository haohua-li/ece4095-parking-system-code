# Autonomous Parking for Self-Driving Cars

Motion planning for automated parking suggested by Akansel Cosgun.
The aim of this project is to deal with parking spot assignments in a smart parking lot. The project assumes the parking lot can percept the environment by using the sensors and automatically assign parking spots to incoming cars.
There are a lot of academic publications focus on a single vehicle, but the parking problem involved with multi-agent has not been extensively studied yet. This is the main reason to perform this project.
The ultimate goal is to develop a robust closed-loop goal assignment algorithm that is specified for automated valet parking scenarios. For now, the project is only at the very beginning phaseâ€¦ Hopefully, I will have time to solve the dynamic scenarios (e.g. vehicles can come in from the entrance or get out of the scene via the exit) in the future.

## Set Up 

- Install Visual Studio 2017 <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/>
- Set up the configurations for OMPL, SDL2 by using [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)
  - SDL2 is deprecated because I was thinking for online simulation previously, but it turns out offline simulation is enough... 
  - OMPL http://ompl.kavrakilab.org/installation.html
  - SDL2 and Visual Studio [Setup SDL2 with VS2019 and vcpkg](https://randoruf.github.io/2021/03/23/install-sdl2-windows.html)
- Set up Python3 environment https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
- Open Project in Visual Studio 2017
